# Why is this project an open-source?
1. It instills trust in our customers. By seeing the code of the app, and its simple mechanics, we hope our customers to trust us.

2. We're fans of wisdom of the crowd! I am capable of speaking Hebrew and English. That's it. If we want to support additional languages, we need YOUR HELP. Do you want the extension to support additional languages besides English, Hebrew and Arabic? You can contribute a dictionary. Do you want to offer additional abbreviations? Suggest them. We're all ears. Can you help us to successfully manipulate text boxes accross the entire web, and throw this SpecialDomain list, making the experience of all of us way more convenient, AMAZING!

3. Help us find bugs.

4. We managed to introduce an NLP model; QAI Al-Safa, but there is more research needed to make it great.

Just send an email to HelpDeskCucumber@Yahoo.Com. We love emails :-)
